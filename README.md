# Teleporter Mod
Rocket teleporter mod for SFS by Osmo, ported to new ModLoader by N2O4.

Thanks to pixelgaming579 and ASoD for allowing to use parts of their code.
# Features
- Ability to change position, velocity, angle and angular velocity of your rocket.
- Ability to set location of the rocket based on altitude and angle.
- Ability to change planet the rocket is located on.
- Game can be paused while teleporting (Not really a thing now, I had to disable it).
- Safety feature that prevents rocket from teleporting below ground and outside SOI (can be disabled).
# How to install
This mod uses Official ModLoader, though for a moment it's not available to everyone yet. How to get it? I'll explain.

When you are in Steam Library, right-click on SFS, select Properties, then Betas. Paste this: `wab4P4muxJLdD8Y1` into the input box that will appear and click "Check Code". If no error message is shown, the game should start updating. After it's done, run it once to generate all the necessary folders.

Now, installing the game. This is rather simple.
1. Download Teleporter.dll from latest release, on PC you should be able to see Releases tab on the right side of your screen.
2. In the game's main menu select "Mod Loader", then click "Open Mods Folder". Paste Teleporter.dll there.

# Notes
- This mod currently uses old IMGUI, will port it to new Mod UI system in near future.
- Pause option is disabled, this one will also be re-added in future
- Mod seems to break player marker's map position after teleporting
- No, this mod is not available for mobile.
